# Testable Java corpus — JV_V15_MAVEN_THINJAR_MONO

Grid cell `MVN-THIN-M` of the 24-cell Java grid.

## Project type

Order pricing and risk domain. The domain layer is byte-identical across all 24 branches
in this family, so any difference in tool output is attributable to the branch variables
below and not to the code the tool was pointed at.

## Branches

This repository holds 432 orphan branches, one per grid cell across every Java version, build system and packaging combination in this corpus. `main` carries the title
only. See `dataset.json` for the machine-readable description of this branch.

## Branch variables

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| Java version | 15 |
| Host JDK | 17 |
| Build system | Maven |
| Packaging | Thin jar |
| Architecture | Monolith |

## Supported tools

19 tools are wired on this branch (one `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/<dir>/` folder
each). **14 of them run on JDK 15 (host JDK 17); 5 do not.**

That is the measurement, not a defect. A tool that cannot run exits **3**,
not 0 -- a skip that looks like a pass is the failure mode this corpus
exists to expose. Every `trigger.yaml` records the real, specific reason
when a tool can't run on this family.

### Running here

| Tool | Role | Block |
|---|---|---|
| `checkstyle` | primary | Lint / Rule Violations |
| `ck` | primary | Cyclomatic Complexity |
| `cpd` | primary | Code Duplication |
| `diff-cover` | primary | Coverage Delta |
| `git-churn` | primary | Code Churn |
| `grype` | alternative | Dependency Risk (SCA) |
| `jacoco` | primary | Statement / Branch / Path Coverage |
| `lizard` | alternative | Cyclomatic Complexity |
| `owasp-dependency-check` | primary | Dependency Risk (SCA) |
| `pit` | primary | Mutation Score |
| `pmd` | primary | Cognitive Complexity |
| `pydriller` | alternative | Code Churn |
| `spoon` | primary | Data Flow Testing |
| `spotbugs` | primary | Static Vulnerabilities (SAST) |

### Dark here

| Tool | Role | Block | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `asm-defuse` | primary | Data Flow Testing | no jar published under a stable coordinate - place one in Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/asm-defuse/ |
| `ba-dua` | primary | All Definition Coverage | ba-dua 0.8.0 links JaCoCo 0.8.1, which stops at Java 10 class files |
| `custom-def-use` | n/a (placeholder) | Data Flow Testing | not a tool - the sheet names no package, version or vendor |
| `nullaway` | primary | All Definition Coverage | runs as an Error Prone compiler plugin, not a standalone step |
| `sonar` | primary | Coverage Delta | needs a running SonarQube server; set SONAR_HOST_URL to enable |

## Build

```
mvn -B clean package
```

Main and test sources both compile at Java 15 (bytecode major version 59), built by
`javac 17` with `--release 15`.

**Text blocks land here.** They were preview in Java 13 (JEP 355) and again in Java 14
(JEP 368), and became final in Java 15 (JEP 378). That is the second three-release preview
arc in this corpus, after switch expressions (preview 12, preview 13, final 14) - and it is
the reason the java13 family's lock had to be API-only. `service/PricingReport.java` carries
the entire Java 15 lock, in both layers:

| Lock | Kind | Since |
|---|---|---|
| text blocks | **parse-time** | 15 (final) |
| `String.formatted` | attribution-time | 15 (final) |
| `String.stripIndent` | attribution-time | 15 (final) |
| `String.translateEscapes` | attribution-time | 15 (final) |
| `CharSequence.isEmpty` | attribution-time | 15 |

`javac --release 14` reports **one** error - the text block - because the parser stops there.
Neutralise the text blocks in a scratch copy and four more appear.

### The three String methods, and why they belong here and not in java13

`String.formatted`, `stripIndent` and `translateEscapes` were evaluated as the **Java 13**
family's lock and rejected. This is the family where they are correct. Measured with
`javac 17` and `javac 25`, reading the exact diagnostic rather than pass/fail:

| `--release` | Status |
|---|---|
| 12 | absent - `cannot find symbol` |
| 13 | present, **deprecated for removal** - warning only, compiles |
| 14 | present, **preview API, disabled by default** - hard error under preview-off |
| **15** | **final - compiles clean** |
| 16 / 17 / 21 / 25 | final - compiles clean |

They shipped in JDK 13 as provisional API alongside preview text blocks, were reclassified
as preview APIs in JDK 14 with JEP 368, and became final in JDK 15. They travel with the
text blocks they were built for, which is why they land in the same family and the same
file.

Two things follow that the corpus's gates now encode. First, **a version lock has to be
checked forward as well as backward** - at java13 these pass the backward check and then
stop compiling one release up. Second, **pass/fail is not enough**: at `--release 13` they
compile with only a deprecation warning, so a gate reading exit status alone would have
called them healthy.

**Records, pattern matching for `instanceof` and sealed types are deliberately absent** -
records and `instanceof` patterns were in their second preview in 15 (final in 16) and
sealed types in their first (final in 17).

Forward-checked at `--release 16, 17, 21` and `25`: clean, so the cumulative ladder holds
above this family.

Java 15 is **not an LTS release**. It shipped September 2020 and reached end of life in
March 2021, six months later. It is in this corpus to complete the version axis, not as
a recommendation.

## Tool test-data folders

Three sibling folders sit at the repo root, alongside this branch's own
`Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/` (above).

### `Tool Triggering (Tool Github Test data)/`
16 of this branch's 19 wired tools carry their own real upstream test suite
or source, pulled as-is from that tool's actual GitHub project -- not
generated: `CK/`, `Spoon/`, `JaCoCo/`, `PMD/`, `SpotBugs/`, `FindSecBugs/`,
`Checkstyle/`, `CPD/`, `PIT/`, `OWASP Dependency-Check/`, `Grype/`, `Lizard/`,
`ASM-DefUse/`, `ba-dua/`, `diff-cover/` and `pydriller/`. The remaining 3
wired tools have no folder here because there is no applicable upstream test
suite to pull: `git-churn` is just git's own log, not a packaged tool;
`nullaway` runs embedded as an Error Prone compiler plugin, not a standalone
artifact; and `sonar` needs a live SonarQube server rather than a static
test suite. (`custom-def-use` is the corpus's own deliberate non-tool
placeholder -- see the Supported tools table above -- so it was never a
candidate for this folder either.)

### `Tool Clean (Synthetic Data)/`
Most tools here carry 18 generated fixture packages, one per JDK family
(`java8` to `java25`), engineered to be clean so the tool should report
zero findings: the **Tool Clean (100% pass)** condition. This branch is
Java 15, so its own family is the `java15` folder inside each tool. Every
tool has a folder for every family, including families it cannot run
(those report not-installed or skipped, they are not left out). The real
tools were run on five of the families (8, 9, 16, 24, 25); the other
thirteen hold the same source, compiled and unit-tested at their own
`--release` only. The tools are `custom-def-use`, `git-churn`, `nullaway`
and `sonar` as well as the sixteen already there.

### `Tool Invalid (Synthetic Data)/`
Same shape as Clean -- the same 18 JDK-family folders -- but engineered so
every fixture makes the tool flag or fail rather than pass: the
**Tool Invalid** condition. `diff-cover`, `git-churn` and `pydriller` each carry one
real git repository's worth of history in both Clean and Invalid rather than 18
per-version copies, restored from `_git-bundles/` via `restore-git.ps1`
rather than kept as a live `.git` folder, so a plain file copy never
silently drops their content.

## Tool entry points

Each tool has `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/<tool>/trigger.yaml` and `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/<tool>/run.sh`. Runners follow the
exit-code contract: 0 ran, 1 failed, 3 skipped-cannot-run, 4 not-installed.

## Planted CVE pins

| Dependency | Version |
|---|---|
| `commons-collections:commons-collections` | 3.2.1 |
| `org.apache.commons:commons-text` | 1.9 |
| `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` | 2.9.10.1 |
| `log4j:log4j` | 1.2.17 |
| `org.yaml:snakeyaml` | 1.30 |

Deliberately vulnerable versions, so the SCA metrics have known true positives. Do not
upgrade them.

## Tools non triggering (Synthetic Data)

A fifth per-branch data folder, beside `Tool Clean (Synthetic Data)`,
`Tool Invalid (Synthetic Data)`, `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)` and
`Tool Triggering (Tool Github Test data)`.

Clean makes each tool run and report nothing wrong. Invalid makes it run and
report something. This folder holds data with nothing in it for any tool to
catch -- and, where no program would reach the tool at all, nothing for it to
start on. It is the negative control that tells *correctly detected nothing*
apart from *the scan never ran*.

`Tools non triggering (Synthetic Data)/` holds 20 tool-named folders, matching the names in Clean
and Invalid so the data sets line up name-for-name:

* **8 tools read source**, so they get a minimal program per boundary
  family (java8 .. java25 (all 18)) -- one class or one function, no branching, no
  duplication, no dependency, no dead export, no magic number.
* **12 tools cannot be answered by a program** -- they read a lockfile,
  a coverage report, compiled bytecode or the commit history -- so they carry
  the subject matter as a plain record instead, with the reason stated in that
  folder's own README.

**No manifest, no lockfile, no tool configuration, no runner and no
`trigger.yaml` anywhere in it**, so the folder adds no discovered project and
no task to a run.

See `Tools non triggering (Synthetic Data)/README.md` for the per-tool table, the mechanism each tool is
inert by, and what was measured.

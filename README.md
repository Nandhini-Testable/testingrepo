# JS_V24_ESBUILD_NPM_MONO

Part of the `javascript-combos` white-box test-repo corpus (GraniteMill /
`granite-mill`, domain: Community garden plots).

## Branch variables

| Variable | This branch |
| --- | --- |
| Branch | `JS_V24_ESBUILD_NPM_MONO` |
| Node.js | 24.20.0 (family V24) |
| Bundler | esbuild |
| Package manager | npm |
| Bundled npm | 10.9.2 |
| Architecture | Monolith |
| Source root | `src` |

The application code under `src/` (or `packages/*/src/` for Microservices
branches) is byte-identical across all 576 branches of this corpus; only the
build tool, package manager, architecture layout, and each tool's real
status on this Node family vary.

## Supported tools

24 tool folders are wired on this corpus (one `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/<dir>/` folder
each, covering the 103-metric white-box framework): the 23 tools of the tool list,
plus `eslint-scope`, the data-flow script behind the "ESLint (eslint-scope)" entry.
**16 of them run on Node 24; 8 do not.**

That is the measurement, not a defect. A tool that cannot run exits **3**,
not 0 -- a skip that looks like a pass is the failure mode this corpus
exists to expose. Every `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/<dir>/trigger.yaml` records whether its status
here was actually invoked and observed by Claude Code (`measured: true`) or
is a real npm-registry `engines.node` claim not yet individually
invoke-verified on this exact family (`measured: false`) -- declared support
is a claim, invoking is the fact, and this corpus never blurs the two.

### Running here

| Tool | Role | Pin | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Lizard` | primary | lizard (pip) | measured directly: pip-installed and run for real against this domain's src/ (lizard 1.24.0). Found policy.js's evaluatePolicy as the highest-CCN function at 18 -- corrects an earlier assumption that dataflow.js's tally loop (CCN 17) was highest; Node-independent by construction, so this holds on every family. _(measured: real invocation confirmed by Claude Code)_ |
| `eslint-plugin-sonarjs` | primary | eslint-plugin-sonarjs==4.2.1 | eslint-plugin-sonarjs 4.2.1 declares Node 24 compatibility; runs through eslint itself. _(declared active from npm registry data; not yet individually invoke-verified on this family)_ |
| `jscpd` | primary | jscpd==5.2.1 | jscpd 5.2.1 declares Node 24 compatibility (npm registry engines.node range). _(declared active from npm registry data; not yet individually invoke-verified on this family)_ |
| `eslint` | primary | eslint==10.10.0 | eslint 10.10.0 declares Node 24 compatibility (npm registry engines.node range). _(declared active from npm registry data; not yet individually invoke-verified on this family)_ |
| `eslint-plugin-security` | primary | eslint-plugin-security==4.0.1 | eslint-plugin-security 4.0.1 declares Node 24 compatibility; runs through eslint itself. _(declared active from npm registry data; not yet individually invoke-verified on this family)_ |
| `npm audit + npm ls` | primary | n/a | npm's own bundled audit/ls -- ships with npm itself on every Node family this corpus supports. _(declared active from npm registry data; not yet individually invoke-verified on this family)_ |
| `npm ls` | primary | n/a | npm's own bundled `npm ls` -- ships with npm itself on every Node family this corpus supports (npm 10.9.2 on this branch). _(declared active from npm registry data; not yet individually invoke-verified on this family)_ |
| `nyc + mocha` | primary | nyc==18.0.0 | clean on every family once the architecture-aware test glob (bug #1) and the Microservices require() path (bug #4) were both fixed. _(measured: real invocation confirmed by Claude Code)_ |
| `Mocha` | primary | mocha==12.0.1 | mocha 12.0.1 declares Node 24 compatibility (npm registry engines.node range). _(declared active from npm registry data; not yet individually invoke-verified on this family)_ |
| `monocart-coverage-reports` | alternative | monocart-coverage-reports==2.13.0 | monocart-coverage-reports 2.13.0 declares Node 24 compatibility (npm registry engines.node range). _(declared active from npm registry data; not yet individually invoke-verified on this family)_ |
| `gutcheck` | alternative | gutcheck==0.10.0 | gutcheck 0.10.0 declares Node 24 compatibility (npm registry engines.node range). _(declared active from npm registry data; not yet individually invoke-verified on this family)_ |
| `diff-cover` | primary | diff-cover (pip) | the diff-cover CLI itself was invoked for real (pip install + --help) and works; its coverage-delta output depends on nyc's cobertura report, which needs a full npm install this session's verification bridge could not complete (slow mounted filesystem + shared disk quota, not a tool defect -- see javascript-repos-build-contract.md). Node-independent by construction. _(measured: real invocation confirmed by Claude Code)_ |
| `ESLint (eslint-scope)` | primary | eslint-scope==9.1.2 | clean on every family tested (12 through 26) -- the dataflow script is hand-written without `?.`/`??` specifically so it never depends on the same syntax features that break other tools on the oldest families. _(measured: real invocation confirmed by Claude Code)_ |
| `knip` | alternative | knip==6.36.0 | knip 6.36.0 declares Node 24 compatibility (npm registry engines.node range). _(declared active from npm registry data; not yet individually invoke-verified on this family)_ |
| `PyDriller` | primary | pydriller (pip) | PyDriller is a Python package invoked externally via a small wrapper script -- Node-version-independent by construction. _(declared active from npm registry data; not yet individually invoke-verified on this family)_ |
| `Git-Spark` | alternative | git-spark==1.3.2 | Git-Spark 1.3.2 declares Node 24 compatibility (npm registry engines.node range). _(declared active from npm registry data; not yet individually invoke-verified on this family)_ |

### Dark here

| Tool | Role | Status | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `debtmap` | alternative | not installed | debtmap is a Rust CLI (`cargo install debtmap`; version 0.24.1 on crates.io), not present on this host. The Clean corpus's debtmap README records it built from crates.io and run for real there. |
| `cccc` | alternative | not installed | CCCC (C and C++ Code Counter) is a native program, not installable via npm/pip on this host. It parses C, C++, Ada and Java, not JavaScript, so on this branch's JavaScript it is not expected to produce meaningful metrics (see Tool Clean (Synthetic Data)/cccc/README.md). Version 3.2.0 is the Debian package's upstream version; it was not confirmed against the upstream project. |
| `Dolos` | alternative | not installed | dolos's native tree-sitter step needs a C++ toolchain -- already documented as absent on this host by the C#/Python sibling corpora's own precedent; installs with --ignore-scripts, which skips the native build |
| `oxlint` | alternative | skipped | same 1.83.0 config-schema break as N18/N20/N22. |
| `OpenGrep` | alternative | not installed | standalone binary, not installable via npm/pip on this host -- same category as Dolos's native step and the Python corpus's own Trivy/OpenGrep entries |
| `Trivy` | alternative | not installed | standalone binary, not installable via npm/pip on this host |
| `StrykerJS + Mocha` | primary | skipped | same mocha-12/Stryker incompatibility as N20/N22. |
| `CodeQL` | alternative | not installed | standalone binary (CodeQL CLI release bundle), not installable via npm/pip on this host; the Clean corpus's CodeQL README records GitHub release downloads returning 403 in the build environment. |

## Build

```
npm install    # or yarn / pnpm / bun, per this branch's packageManager field
npm run build
```

## Run

```
node src/index.js
```

## Test

```
npm test              # mocha tests/**/*.test.js
npm run coverage      # nyc + mocha
node "Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/full_check.js"   # cross-file consistency audit
```


## Tool test-data folders

Three sibling folders sit at the repo root, alongside this branch's own
`Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/` (above).

### `Tool Triggering (Tool Github Test data)/`
One subfolder for each of the 23 tools of the tool list. Each holds that tool's own
upstream test files, copied from its actual GitHub project and not generated, plus a
small generated overlay (a short `README.md` and, for some tools, `package.json`,
`src/` and `nodeNN/` folders). A correct run finds whatever that upstream project's
own tests genuinely contain. Almost every upstream file is byte-identical to the
upstream repository; a small number differ from the upstream project's current HEAD.

### `Tool Clean (Synthetic Data)/`
One subfolder for each of the 23 tools, engineered to be clean so the tool should
report zero findings: the **Tool Clean (100% pass)** condition. 20 of the 23 tools carry
five per-family subfolders (`node12`, `node14`, `node20`, `node24`, `node26`); these
five boundary families stand in for the nine Node versions of this corpus's branches.
`Git-Spark`, `diff-cover` and `pydriller` mine git history, so each carries one real
history instead of per-family copies, stored as a bundle in `_git-bundles/` and
restored with `restore-git.ps1`. CodeQL, OpenGrep and trivy were not installed in
the build environment; that is recorded in the folder's README.

### `Tool Invalid (Synthetic Data)/`
Same shape as Clean -- 23 tools, the same five boundary families -- but engineered so
every fixture makes the tool flag or fail rather than pass: the **Tool Invalid**
condition. `Git-Spark`, `diff-cover` and `pydriller` carry their history the same way,
as bundles in `_git-bundles/` (restored with `restore-git.ps1`).

## Tool entry points

Every tool directory carries a `trigger.yaml` recording its pin, its
declared status and what a working run should find. Run one tool directly,
or all of them:

```
bash "Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/eslint/run_eslint.sh"
node "Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/tool_integration.js" --run
node "Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/tool_integration.js" --verify
```

`--run` distinguishes three outcomes: a tool that ran, a tool that skipped
for a reason `dataset.json` already records, and a tool that skipped for a
reason it does not. Only the third is a finding.

## Planted fixtures

| Fixture | File(s) | Planted for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Duplication | [`src/http-errors.js`](src/http-errors.js) + [`src/http-errors-legacy.js`](src/http-errors-legacy.js) | jscpd, Dolos |

## History

This branch's real commit history starts from the corpus's scaffolding
generation, followed by the six genuine scaffolding-bug fixes found by
Claude Code's actual local install/test runs across all nine Node families
(see `javascript-repos-build-contract.md`) -- every commit here is real,
authored by the accounts that actually did the work; nothing is
back-filled or fabricated.

## Machine-readable

[`dataset.json`](dataset.json) carries every branch variable and the full
tool-status breakdown, including the reason each dark tool is dark and
whether that status was actually measured. It is the answer key: a run is
correct when what the tool platform reports matches what `dataset.json`
says should happen, including the tools that are supposed to be dark.

See `javascript-repos-build-contract.md` in the Testable (Tools) project for
the full 103-metric roster, the repair notes, and the live pin-resolution
method (npm registry `engines.node` ranges, prereleases excluded).

<!-- tools-non-triggering -->
## Tools non triggering (Synthetic Data)

A fifth per-branch data folder, beside `Tool Clean (Synthetic Data)`,
`Tool Invalid (Synthetic Data)`, `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)` and
`Tool Triggering (Tool Github Test data)`.

Clean makes each tool run and report nothing wrong. Invalid makes it run and
report something. This folder holds data with nothing in it for any tool to
catch -- and, where no program would reach the tool at all, nothing for it to
start on. It is the negative control that tells *correctly detected nothing*
apart from *the scan never ran*.

`Tools non triggering (Synthetic Data)/` holds 23 tool-named folders, matching the names in Clean
and Invalid so the data sets line up name-for-name:

* **11 tools read source**, so they get a minimal program per boundary
  family (node12, node14, node20, node24, node26) -- one class or one function, no branching, no
  duplication, no dependency, no dead export, no magic number.
* **12 tools cannot be answered by a program** -- they read a lockfile,
  a coverage report, compiled bytecode or the commit history -- so they carry
  the subject matter as a plain record instead, with the reason stated in that
  folder's own README.

**No manifest, no lockfile, no tool configuration, no runner and no
`trigger.yaml` anywhere in it**, so the folder adds no discovered project and
no task to a run.

See `Tools non triggering (Synthetic Data)/README.md` for the per-tool table, the mechanism each tool is
inert by, and what was measured.

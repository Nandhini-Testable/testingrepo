# orderlab -- PY_V314_UV_POETRY_MICRO

Order-pricing domain used as a white-box tool-evaluation fixture. One branch of
the Python 3.14 family: 24 branches across 3 build backends, 4 package managers
and 2 architectures. The domain layer is byte-identical on every branch, so any
difference in tool output is attributable to the branch variables alone.

## Branch variables

| Variable | This branch |
|---|---|
| Branch | `PY_V314_UV_POETRY_MICRO` |
| Python | 3.14.0rc2 |
| Build backend | uv_build 0.12.9 |
| Backend metadata | pyproject [project] |
| Package manager | poetry 2.4.2 |
| Architecture | Microservices |
| Scenario | 2 - Microservices |
| Source root | `packages/domain/src` |
| Branch usable | yes |

> **Build backend.** uv_build 0.12.9 -- MANDATES PEP 621 [project] and requires Python >=3.8, comfortably below this family. Runs at the current latest release, not a rolled-back one.

> **Package manager.** poetry 2.4.2 -- the current latest release. On the 2.x line it reads and writes PEP 621 [project]; the [tool.poetry] table it still accepts is a compatibility path, not the source of truth.

## Supported tools

29 tools are wired on this branch: 15 primary and 14 alternative, covering the
103-metric white-box framework. **29 of them can run on Python 3.14;
0 cannot.**

That is the measurement, not a defect. Every tool is pinned at its current
latest release, identically on all 24 branches, and the pins that this
interpreter excludes are guarded with an environment marker so they drop out of
resolution instead of failing it. A tool that cannot run exits **3**, not 0 --
a skip that looks like a pass is the failure mode this corpus exists to expose.

### Running here

| Tool | Role | Pin | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CrossHair` | primary | `crosshair-tool==0.0.110` | crosshair-tool 0.0.110 declares >=3.8 but its real floor is 3.9. |
| `Coverage.py` | primary | `coverage==7.16.0` | Coverage.py 7.16.0 declares >=3.10. |
| `Pymcdc` | primary | `pymcdc==0.2.6` | pymcdc 0.2.6 declares >=3.10. |
| `Radon` | primary | `radon==6.0.1` | radon 6.0.1 declares no Requires-Python and imports cleanly on 3.8.. |
| `Lizard` | primary | `lizard==1.24.0` | lizard 1.24.0 -- a silent import crash on the 3.6 family, working from 3.7 onward. |
| `testmon` | primary | `pytest-testmon==2.2.0` | pytest-testmon 2.2.0 declares >=3.10. |
| `cognitive-ast` | primary | _binary / stdlib_ | Not a PyPI package -- no distribution of that name exists. |
| `jscpd` | primary | `jscpd@5.1.1` | jscpd 5.1.1 is an npm package that runs on Node, not on the project interpreter, so the Python version is irrelevant to it. |
| `pylint` | primary | `pylint==4.0.8` | pylint 4.0.8 declares >=3.10. |
| `Semgrep OSS` | primary | `semgrep==1.176.0` | semgrep 1.176.0 declares >=3.10, and bandit 1.9.4 with it. |
| `Bandit` | primary | `bandit==1.9.4` | bandit 1.9.4 declares >=3.10. |
| `pip-audit` | primary | `pip-audit==2.10.1` | pip-audit 2.10.1 declares >=3.10. |
| `cosmic-ray` | primary | `cosmic-ray==8.7.0` | cosmic-ray 8.7.0 declares >=3.9. |
| `Beniget` | primary | `beniget==0.5.0` | beniget 0.5.0 declares >=3.6 and means it. |
| `PyDriller` | primary | `pydriller==2.11` | pydriller 2.11 works. |
| `Ruff` | alternative | `ruff==0.16.6` | ruff 0.16.6 -- alternative for 19 of the 103 metrics. |
| `complexipy` | alternative | `complexipy==8.0.0` | complexipy 8.0.0 declares >=3.8. |
| `symilar (pylint)` | alternative | `pylint==4.0.8` | symilar ships inside pylint 4.0.8, so it arrives with it. |
| `Opengrep` | alternative | _binary / stdlib_ | Standalone binary with its own parser. |
| `Opengrep (taint mode)` | alternative | _binary / stdlib_ | Same binary, taint mode. |
| `Trivy` | alternative | _binary / stdlib_ | Standalone binary; scans manifests and lockfiles, never the interpreter. |
| `SlipCover` | alternative | `slipcover==1.1.0` | slipcover 1.1.0 declares >=3.9,<3.15. |
| `mutmut` | alternative | `mutmut==3.7.0` | mutmut 3.7.0 declares >=3.10. |
| `diff-cover` | alternative | `diff-cover==10.5.1` | diff-cover 10.5.1 declares >=3.10. |
| `astroid` | alternative | `astroid==4.0.4` | astroid 4.0.4, NOT the latest 4.3.1 -- and this is the one place in the corpus where the latest-everywhere policy had to yield. |
| `pyan3 + astroid` | alternative | `pyan3==2.8.1` | pyan3 2.8.1 declares >=3.10,<3.16. |
| `pylint + vulture` | alternative | `vulture==2.16` | vulture 2.16 declares >=3.9. |
| `dulwich` | alternative | `dulwich==1.2.14` | dulwich 1.2.14 declares >=3.10. |
| `sys.settrace driver (stdlib)` | alternative | _binary / stdlib_ | stdlib sys.settrace driver, written 3.6-compatible.. |

### Dark here

_(none)_

**One tool on this branch would lie about itself, and the pin is
what stops it.** With pydantic at its current latest, `semgrep` passes
`Requires-Python`, installs, and `import semgrep` succeeds -- then invoking it
raises `AssertionError` from inside pydantic. Declared support, installation
and importability are all clean and all useless, which is the failure mode this
corpus established at 3.8 and has not seen since. Holding pydantic at 2.12.3
restores it. Separately, `beniget` remains `active-degraded` for the third
family running: it runs, exits 0, and its output is wrong.

### What moved since the earlier families

| | 3.9 | 3.10 | 3.11 | 3.12 | 3.13 | 3.14 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tools running | 16 | 29 | 29 | 29 | 29 | **29** |
| Silent liars | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **1, then pinned out** |
| Degraded (runs, wrong) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | **1** |
| Branches that build | 24/24 | 24/24 | 24/24 | 24/24 | 24/24 | **24/24** |
| Infra pins at latest | uv, wheel | all 7 | all 7 | all 7 | all 7 | **all 7** |
| Interpreter | final | final | final | final | final | **release candidate** |

- **semgrep dies on this interpreter, and the cause is a private
  API.** pydantic 2.13.5 calls `typing._eval_type(..., prefer_fwd_module=True)`;
  3.14 renamed that keyword to `parent_fwdref` in the PEP 649/749 typing
  rework. pydantic swallows the resulting `TypeError` into a fallback whose
  `assert isinstance(value, ForwardRef)` then fails, because under PEP 649 the
  FORWARDREF format yields a `str`. `import semgrep` still succeeds; only
  invoking it dies -- the silent-liar shape, and the first since 3.8.
- **pydantic is therefore held at 2.12.3**, the newest release that works here.
  It is a transitive dependency, not a roster tool, so this is the
  "infrastructure is pinned to what actually runs" half of the policy. A dark
  SAST primary would distort the corpus far more than a transitive held one
  minor release back. Verified: `semgrep --version`, a real `semgrep scan`, and
  `pip check` all clean.
- **PEP 750 template strings are the first new syntax since PEP 695, and
  nothing breaks.** radon, lizard, ruff, pylint, vulture, bandit, complexipy,
  pymcdc, astroid, gast, beniget and pyan3 all read them correctly. Recorded
  because the 3.12 experience made the opposite the reasonable expectation.
- **PEP 649 deferred annotations are transparent through `__annotations__`.**
  Identical output on 3.13 and 3.14 for resolvable annotations. The laziness is
  only observable from inside the typing internals.
- **beniget is degraded for the third family running**, still 0.5.0, still
  unfixed -- and the construct space is now COMPLETE: this fixture adds
  ParamSpec (`**P`) and TypeVarTuple (`*Ts`), and the degradation extends to
  both exactly as it does to TypeVar.

## Build

```
make setup        # python -m pip install 'poetry==2.4.2'
make install      # poetry install
```

> Both the backend and the package manager on this branch run on Python 3.14.0rc2 for real; the branch installs, locks and tests cleanly.

## Run

```
python -m orderlab
```

Each service is importable on its own:

```
python -c "from gateway_service import health; print(health())"
python -c "from pricing_service import quote; print(quote('gold', 600, 'retail', 'US', 100.0))"
```


## Test

```
make test         # pytest 9.1.1
make check        # Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/full_check.py -- cross-file consistency audit
```

pytest is pinned at 9.1.1, which is its current latest
release. It is infrastructure, not one of the 29 roster tools, and so is exempt
from the latest-only policy either way: a branch whose tests cannot run is not
a branch.

### Microservices

Five workspace members. `packages/domain` holds the same byte-identical domain
as the monolith branches; `packages/contracts` holds the wire schema with no
third-party dependency at all, so a service whose own dependencies failed to
install still fails for its own reason. Three services consume both.

`services/gateway_service` is where untrusted input enters. That makes the
microservices branches the mirror image of the monolith ones for taint
analysis: the same domain code, reached through a request envelope rather than
through argv and environment. A tool that scores the two architectures
differently is telling you about its source model, not about the code.



## Tool test-data folders

Three sibling folders sit at the repo root, alongside this branch's own
`Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/` (above).

### `Tool Triggering (Tool Github Test data)/`
Each of the 28 tool subfolders is that tool's own real upstream test suite,
pulled as-is from its actual GitHub project -- not generated. `Radon/` is
radon's own pytest suite; `pydriller/` is pydriller's own test suite;
`Opengrep/` is the real opengrep/semgrep test corpus (1,000+ files of rules,
parsing fixtures and snapshots). A correct run finds whatever that upstream
project's own tests genuinely contain.

### `Tool Clean (Synthetic Data)/`
25 of the 28 tools each carry 5 generated fixture packages, one per Python
interpreter (3.6, 3.7, 3.11, 3.13, 3.14), each a self-contained package
(`pyproject.toml`, `src/<module>/`, `tests/`) under its own invented domain
name -- engineered to be clean, so the tool should report zero findings:
the **Tool Clean (100% pass)** condition. The remaining 3 tools
(`diff-cover`, `dulwich`, `pydriller`) operate on git history rather than
interpreter syntax, so each carries one real git repository's worth of
history instead of 5 per-version copies -- restored from `_git-bundles/`
via `restore-invalid-git.ps1` rather than kept as a live `.git` folder, so a
plain file copy never silently drops their content. `_generator/` holds the
scripts that built every fixture.

### `Tool Invalid (Synthetic Data)/`
Same shape as Clean -- 25 tools x 5 Python-version fixtures, plus the same
3 git-history tools -- but every fixture is engineered to make the tool
flag or fail rather than pass: the **Tool Invalid** condition. `_git-bundles/`
backs up each git-history tool's real history, with `restore-invalid-git.ps1`
to rebuild it; `live_results.json` and this folder's own README/archive
travel with it.

## Tool entry points

Every tool directory carries a `trigger.yaml` recording its pin, its declared
floor, its measured status on this interpreter and what a working run should
find. Run one tool directly, or all of them:

```
bash "Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/radon/run_radon.sh"
python "Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/tool_integration.py" --run
python "Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/tool_integration.py" --verify
```

`--run` distinguishes three outcomes: a tool that ran, a tool that skipped for
a reason `dataset.json` already records, and a tool that skipped for a reason
it does not. Only the third is a finding.

## Planted fixtures

Every tool is pointed at something it should find. Without these, a tool that
ran and reported nothing is indistinguishable from a tool that silently
no-opped.

| Fixture | File | Planted for |
|---|---|---|
| Duplication | [`packages/domain/src/orderlab/services/retail_order_processor.py`](packages/domain/src/orderlab/services/retail_order_processor.py) + [`wholesale_order_processor.py`](packages/domain/src/orderlab/services/wholesale_order_processor.py) | jscpd, symilar |
| Complexity | [`packages/domain/src/orderlab/analysis/complexity_sample.py`](packages/domain/src/orderlab/analysis/complexity_sample.py) | Radon, Lizard, complexipy, cognitive-ast |
| Lint | [`packages/domain/src/orderlab/analysis/lint_violations.py`](packages/domain/src/orderlab/analysis/lint_violations.py) | pylint, Ruff |
| SAST | [`packages/domain/src/orderlab/analysis/sast_fixture.py`](packages/domain/src/orderlab/analysis/sast_fixture.py) | Semgrep + Bandit, Opengrep |
| Taint | [`packages/domain/src/orderlab/analysis/taint_fixture.py`](packages/domain/src/orderlab/analysis/taint_fixture.py) | Opengrep taint mode |
| Dead code | [`packages/domain/src/orderlab/analysis/dead_code.py`](packages/domain/src/orderlab/analysis/dead_code.py) | vulture, pylint |
| Call graph | [`packages/domain/src/orderlab/analysis/call_graph_sample.py`](packages/domain/src/orderlab/analysis/call_graph_sample.py) | pyan3 + astroid, Beniget |
| Vulnerable pins | [`requirements-runtime.txt`](requirements-runtime.txt) | pip-audit, Trivy |

The duplicate pair also co-changes three times in the git history, so a
change-coupling tool and a duplication tool should agree on it.

The five planted pins carry 45 live advisories between them,
confirmed against the PyPI JSON API on 3 September 2026. The planted set is unchanged from 3.10 onward -- `urllib3`
2.2.2 and `paramiko` 2.10.1 -- so the SCA metrics are directly comparable
across those five families.

`six` sits beside them in a clearly separated support section — paramiko
2.10.1 imports it without declaring it, and cryptography 42 no
longer supplies it by accident. Every one is genuinely imported by
[`packages/domain/src/orderlab/platform/integrations.py`](packages/domain/src/orderlab/platform/integrations.py) --
a pin nothing imports produces a manifest-versus-source disagreement that looks
like a tool defect and is not.

## History

Roughly 45 synthetic commits, authored as Prajith Kumaravel with three
co-authors carried in `Co-authored-by:` trailers. Measured on this family:
14-20% of commits each, three distinct names. A history tool
that reads only the author field reports one contributor at 100% and is wrong.
The processor pair co-changes three times; the tool runners co-change as a
cluster.

## Machine-readable

[`dataset.json`](dataset.json) carries every branch variable, the full tool
status breakdown with the verbatim reason for each dark tool, and the planted
fixture inventory. It is the answer key: a run is correct when what the tool
platform reports matches what `dataset.json` says should happen, **including
the tools that are supposed to be dark**.

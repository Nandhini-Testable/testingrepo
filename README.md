# OrderKit - CS_VNET10_SDKMSBUILD_PAKET_MONO

One branch of the C# tool-evaluation corpus. Test **data**, not a product: tool
execution is not part of the build, and evaluation happens later.

## Branch

`CS_VNET10_SDKMSBUILD_PAKET_MONO`

## Cell

| Axis | Value |
|---|---|
| Bundler | SDK-style MSBuild |
| Package manager | Paket |
| Architecture | Monolith |

Projects:

- `OrderKit` (`src/OrderKit`)

## Target framework

`net10.0` - .NET 10

The top of the corpus: current LTS, supported to 10 November 2028, and the highest C# version the pinned SDK can compile. The SDK moved once, at net9; this family needs no further move. packages.config remains dead -- six of the 24 cells impossible, seven families running.

## Language version

C# 14.0, taken as the default of the target framework. `LangVersion` is deliberately
never written to any project file, which is what keeps the family axis one number
instead of two.

The domain layer is written to that language subset exactly, and the lock is
verified by execution rather than asserted:

```
csc -langversion:14.0   ->  clean
csc -langversion:13.0   ->  error CS8025: Feature 'async function' is not available
```

## Supported tools

11 of the 19 tools in the roster are expected to fire on this branch. The rest exit
3 (cannot run here) or 4 (absent from this host), each with its reason in both
`run.sh` and `trigger.yaml`.

**A tool that does not fire is a result, not a failure.** The source-level tools
below never load a compiler, so they remain the built-in negative control: if the
build-backed tools go dark, these still distinguish "correctly detected nothing"
from "the scan never ran".

## Tool versions

Tool pins follow the C# sheet of the Whitebox Tools Registry. `dataset.json`
`toolPins` is the machine-readable copy.

| Tool | Version | Declared in |
|---|---|---|
| Coverlet (`coverlet.collector`) | 6.0.0 | `paket.dependencies` |
| Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers | 8.0.0 | `paket.dependencies` |
| SonarAnalyzer.CSharp | 9.32.0.97167 | `paket.dependencies` |
| SecurityCodeScan.VS2019 | 5.6.7 | `paket.dependencies` |
| OpenTelemetry + OTLP exporter | 1.19.1 | `paket.dependencies` |
| AltCover (`altcover.global`) | 8.8.173 | `.config/dotnet-tools.json` |
| Stryker.NET (`dotnet-stryker`) | 4.0.0 | `.config/dotnet-tools.json` |
| Paket | 11.0.1 | `.config/dotnet-tools.json` |
| Lizard | 1.17.10 | scanning host |
| jscpd | 4.0.5 | scanning host |
| Semgrep | 1.50.0 | scanning host |
| PyDriller | 2.7 | scanning host |

Two pins are not the registry's own. It lists AltCover 8.8.0, which was never
published as a tool; 8.8.173 is the release of that line. It lists no version for
OpenTelemetry.

Stryker.NET 4.0.0 is pinned because the registry names it, not because it works
here: it writes no report on this family. See `tools/stryker/run.sh`.

## Build

```bash
./build.sh
```

The prerequisites are a .NET SDK that satisfies `global.json` and access to
`api.nuget.org`. A bare `dotnet restore OrderKit.sln` is enough on a fresh clone:
`.paket/Paket.Restore.targets` restores the Paket tool from
`.config/dotnet-tools.json`, and Paket then restores the packages in `paket.lock`.

`global.json` names SDK 8.0.100 with `rollForward: latestMajor`. That is deliberate: a
host that selects its runtime from the `global.json` version and only registers
an 8.0 runtime can still place this branch, and the CLI then rolls forward to the
newest SDK installed. The build succeeds only where an SDK that can target this
framework is present; an older one stops at restore with NETSDK1045.

## Test

```bash
dotnet test OrderKit.sln
```

19 test methods are declared; NUnit expands them to 21 cases, all passing.

## Tool entry points

```bash
python3 tools/tool_integration.py            # banner
python3 tools/tool_integration.py --verify   # every runner present and executable
python3 tools/tool_integration.py --run      # run them all, compare to dataset.json
python3 tools/full_check.py                  # cross-file consistency audit
```

## What is expected to fire

`dataset.json` asserts the answer rather than describing it, so a platform that
reports nothing for a given tool can be *proven* correct instead of assumed correct.
Every runner's expected exit code is recorded there, and
`tool_integration.py --run` exits **2** if any tool produces a result the dataset
does not already record - a new finding, as distinct from a measurement.
